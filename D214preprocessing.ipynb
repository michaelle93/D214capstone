    "#### Capstone Project Name\n",
    "Multiple Linear Regression analysis on Rideshare dataset\n",
    "#### Context\n",
    "The contribution of this study to the field of data analytics and the MSDA program is to create a\n",
    "regression model to find statistical significance between the dependent variable and the independent variables.\n",
    "This study will allow for a better understanding of the patterns of the lifestyle, rush hour, and commuting\n",
    "practices (Chao, 2019). It will also provide better understanding of the prices Uber and Lyft charges and what\n",
    "factors into the price of a ride. Does location, time, day, and weather affect price? Does these also have an\n",
    "effect on the surcharges? The multiple linear regression method is to estimate the different variables that affect\n",
    "the pricing of Uber and Lyft rides.\n",
    "#### Hypothesis\n",
    "    Null hypothesis-. a predictive multiple linear regression cannot be constructed from the dataset\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Alternate Hypothesis-. a predictive multiple linear regression can be constructed from the dataset\n",
    "#### Project Outcomes\n",
    "This project is to create a multiple linear regression to assess the association of multiple\n",
    "independent variables and a single dependent variable (Multiple linear regression analysis 2013). Support for\n",
    "the alternative hypothesis is found in Chao (2019), where a linear regression model was performed and found\n",
    "that there was significance between the variables and price of fares."

    "### B) Data Collection\n",
    "The dataset will be downloaded from kaggle.com which is available to the public as a csv file. Two files will be given: a file of the cab ride and a file of the weather. It will be cleaned and preprocessed in Python. Two datasets will be used for this study. The first dataset contains data about the cab rides of Uber and Lyft. These variables include distance, cab_type, timestamp, destination, source, price, surcharge_multiplier, id, product id, and name. This dataset also contains over 693,000 rows of data and composed 10 columns. The second dataset contains data about the weather which includes variables such as temp, location, clouds, pressure, rain, time_stamp, humidity, and wind. This dataset has over 6200 rows of data and composed of 8 columns. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data sparsity is about 7.95% for the cab ride dataset\n",
    "The data sparsity is about 11% for the weather dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Both datasets will be merged during the preprocessing portion. In order to merge the two data sets the ‘time’ variable from the sets will be matched by the hour. Any values null in price will be dropped. The timestamp is in epoch format which will need to be converted to readable time data. ID and Product ID are not needed for this study and can be dropped. \n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of using this dataset is that this dataset is made available to the public for other studies. The disadvantage of this dataset is the time frame of collecting data for this dataset was about a month and a half. \n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge faced on collecting this data was that this data used for the research question came in two files. The two files need to be merged into one file to properly utilize all the information for the study. \n"
